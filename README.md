### 🚗 Used Car Sales Analysis

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes used car sales data to identify key factors influencing sale prices. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling to build a machine learning model for price estimation.

#### 📊 Dataset & Key Features
Vehicle Details: Type, Make, Model, Lot Year
Condition Indicators: ACV, Odometer, Repair Estimate, Damage Severity, Run Condition
Time Factors: Assignment Date, Loss Date, Invoice Date
Target Variable: Sale Price

#### 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handled missing values using imputation and categorical encoding
Removed duplicates and irrelevant columns
Addressed inconsistencies in date fields
Applied feature engineering (e.g., extracted month & year from date fields)

#### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized sale price distributions and trends over time
Analyzed the impact of vehicle condition and manufacturer on sale price
Examined correlations between numerical features

#### 🤖 Model Development
Algorithms Implemented: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
Best Model: Random Forest performed the best in explaining the data compared to other models. Further improvements can be made through Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation.

#### 📌 Conclusion
The project highlights critical factors impacting used car sale prices and provides a predictive model for price estimation. The Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance, with room for further optimization.
